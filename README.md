# FCMSender

Small project to be able to send and test Push Notification using Firebase Cloud Messaging.

To use it, you need to provide your `service-account.json` files that can be obtained from [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
Navigate to the **Service Accounts** tab. Under **Firebase Admin SDK** section, click on **Generate new private key** button that will generate a json file with the **Firebase Credentials**.
It will download your `service-account.json` that you need to put into `resources` folder.
